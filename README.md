Candidate is and online CV Platform. It is designed to help recruiters find their ideal candidates as quickly as possible.

How it works:
At sign up there are two options, Candidate and Recruiter. The Candidate option allows you to create a candidate account in which you will be able to create your CV. Upon sign in you land on the user dashboard with the CV display and a navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar has three buttons, Delete Account, Logout and Edit CV. The Edit CV button, as the name suggests, takes the user to a page with the CV form where they can edit their CV
The Second option, Recruiter, creates a recruiter account and on login takes the user to the recruiter's dashboard with candidate cards. These cards show a candidate's name, career field, experience in years and profile picture.

The recruiter's dashboard has a search bar that takes in two search parameter, career field and experience in years. This makes finding the ideal candidate a hassle free task. Upon clicking the user card the recruiter is then redirected to a page  that will display the user's full cv (created in the candidate section) including contact information should they wish to contact the candidate for a possible interview.

Technologies used:
The project was built using python's Django framework and all the dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. The search function was built using the django-filter package.
The database is a PostgreSQL database.
